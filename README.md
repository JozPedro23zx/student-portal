# Nest.js System School Management

  

### Overview:

This project is a school management system developed using NestJS, aimed at practicing and enhancing my backend development skills. The system simulates a school application and allows for the management of users, students, teachers, classes, enrollments, grades, subjects, and more. It is built using TypeScript and adheres to the best practices of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This simple project serves as a practical exercise to solidify my understanding and implementation of these concepts in a real-world scenario.
